	<h2>What Will I be Learning?</h2>
	<p>Time zones, and Daylight Savings can be confusing,
	  so here's what we will be exploring:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>How Time Zone borders vary</li>
	  <li>Relationship between Local Time and Time Zones</li>
	  <li>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</li>
	  <li>Time Zones defined by UTC offset</li>
	  <li>And More!</li>
	</ul>
	<div id="datetime">
	  <!-- Instead of a video here, I will place the current date and time -->
	  <p>For now, let's settle for finding the current date and time in New York, USA.
	    It is in Eastern Time, with offset UTC - 5:00. Meaning 5 hours behind Coordinated
	    Universal Time. Don't worry if you did not understand everything, we'll go
	    into detail in the course.

	<h2>Who Will Teach Me?</h2>
	<p>A Georgia Institute of Technology student who maybe knows too a little too much about the time zone rules
	  set in place. Most importantly, since this is not a real course, and only a webpage,
	  you will learn even better from google, using chrome:
